## Summary Chapter 1 - The heart and the salamander

Montag is a fireman, he burns books (and houses), which he enjoys. On his way home he meets Clarisse McClellan. She is an odd girl who makes Montag think and reflect about what he's doing and why. 

Later, when Montag gets home, he sees that his wife has overdosed on sleeping pills. She gets rescued and forgets what happened. This makes him question his marriage too. Clarisse enforces his marriage-doubts with a flower that tells you if you're in love. According to the flower, Montag is not. 

Montag travels to work. While there, a mechanical hound shows hostility towards  him. This will probably play a part later in the story. We are introduced to Captain Beatty.

He talks to Clarisse again, but this is the last time because she disappears after.

At work Montag voices his concerns about burning books. We learn about the story of the firemen, but not why they are burning books. At work they get a mission to burn another house. At that house Montag burns the books as usual, but there is a woman there. For the first time ever Montag sees a victim of the fire and that she is willing to die for the books. Montag wants to know what's in the books and why someone would die for them, so he saves one from the fire. 

He decides to stay home the next day because he's in shock. Captain Beatty comes over and tells the real story of the firmemen. In short they burn books becuase ignorance is happiness. If no one i smarter than another people wont feel inferior. 

We learn that Montag has a lot of books at home.
