### Summary Chapter 1 - The heart and the salamander

Montag is a fireman, he burns books (and houses), which he enjoys. On his way home he meets Clarisse McClellan. She is an odd girl who makes Montag think and reflect about what he's doing and why. 

Later, when Montag gets home, he sees that his wife has overdosed on sleeping pills. She gets rescued and forgets what happened. This makes him question his marriage too. Clarisse enforces his marriage-doubts with a flower that tells you if you're in love. According to the flower, Montag is not. 

Montag travels to work. While there, a mechanical hound shows hostility towards  him. This will probably play a part later in the story. We are introduced to Captain Beatty.

He talks to Clarisse again, but this is the last time because she disappears after.

At work Montag voices his concerns about burning books. We learn about the story of the firemen, but not why they are burning books. At work they get a mission to burn another house. At that house Montag burns the books as usual, but there is a woman there. For the first time ever Montag sees a victim of the fire and that she is willing to die for the books. Montag wants to know what's in the books and why someone would die for them, so he saves one from the fire. 

He decides to stay home the next day because he's in shock. Captain Beatty comes over and tells the real story of the firmemen. In short they burn books becuase ignorance is happiness. If no one i smarter than another people wont feel inferior. 

We learn that Montag has a lot of books at home.

#### Guy Montag
From chapter 1:
Guy Montag works as a fireman. Firemen burn books for a living. His life is kind fo numb and quite reptetive. This changes more on that later. Montag often acts his feeling. When he wonders about the firemen origins, he ask. 

// When his wife tried to kill herself, he says it to her, voices his concerns (I think). With clarisse he.... ... I feel like Montag does not act his feelings. For example after his wife nearly took

After a while we can understand that burning books is his life, it's what he lives for. Because his wife means bearly nothing to him. Whis we learn when his wife made a suicide attempt and during their relation after that. They never act as they love eachother, or at least Mildred don't. Montag is very upset after the suicide attempt. This could be because he has some love for Mildred or that he just realiese that their relationships is empty. This because Mildred doesn't feel like their relationship is wort living for. You also get a feeling that Mildred only is with montag for his money, more on that somewhere else. 

The conversations with Clarisse is the only thing he seems to actually care about, except burning books. I get a sense that he likes to live risky. Jumps down hole and grabs pole last second. This point is strenghtened when we find out he is taking books. 

Under the  course of the first chapter Montag breaks loose from his very repetetive habits; Going to work, return from work on repeat. He starts bonding with clarisse, which also becomes a habit to him. This we know because he is very surprised when she dissapears. 
He loves habits and forms new ones easily.

Clarisse has a large impact on Montags life. Through the conversations with Clarisse he also starts thinking. He starts to doubt his marriage, why he is bruning books. As mentioned earlier, books is his life. He is questioning his life.

"Not everyone born free an equal, ... , but everyone made equal"
+
"You always dread the unfamiliar"

I interpret this as the reason why there are book-burnings. "Everyone is born equal", complies that you change after your birth. And when Beatty says that everyone is *made* equal, which extends the period of time we are equal. By banning books, no one can learn new thing, everyone as dumb.
