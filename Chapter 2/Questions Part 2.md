## Part 2. “The Sieve and the Sand” - Discussion Questions

1. **In thinking about Clarisse’s friendship and her death, Montag goes “…trembling along the hall to the kitchen” (p. 94). Why has his brief interaction with her made such an impact on him?**
Accoding to what he says to Mildred; Clarisse was the first person who looked on him like he counted, like he was more than just your avarage person. He liked that Clarisse cared about more than just herself, like everyone else in this soicety, like Mildred. 



2. **How does Montag answer Mildred when she asks why she should read? What does their exchange indicate about the differences between them?**
In the exchange we understand that Mildred values her "family" (the parlour thing) and the investment gone into it. (Which we kind of already knew). She doesn't care about anything else.

Montag cares about the other people in the world, he wants to know things, for example why they are hated. This is partly because of Clarisse but it seems that he had it in him before. For example when he spares the professor.


3. **Although Montag’s country has won “two atomic wars since 1960” (p. 96), the threat of another war grows stronger. What reason does Montag give for the country being hated so much? How might books help Montag’s countrymen relate to peoples of other countries?**

He thinks his country is hated because of thei weath while the others starve. People can see what mistakes have been done and stop them from happening again.

with books people would relaise that the countrypeople perspective and people start forming their own opinions and thereby dont like the government rgdafngi

perspective
you get perspective from books
the government dont want outsiders perspective to come to the countrymen

4. **How does the sieve and the sand analogy apply to Montag?**

You could say that his books are the sand. He has so much information, which is represented by the dime, which he depereatly wants. But it will all just pour between his fingers because he cant save it all. 

Or the bible is the sand in this case.

**5. When Montag visits Faber, Faber calls himself a coward. Why? In what way has he acted cowardly?**

He could have acted against the book burnings. 

**6. Faber tells Montag; “It’s not books you need, it’s some of the things that once were in books” (p. 107). What is it that Montag needs and is searching for?**

Faber later talks a lot about "records", old things and that we in books stored a lot of things "we were afraid we might forget". 

I interpret this as Montag is in need of "what used to be", or what happened. In the books present the world is shallow, (which we mostly know because of Montags realtionship with Mildred. She represets th outer world). Me theory is that faber thinks that Montag wants life as it used to be, not so shallow and caring. 

This is strengthened by Faber when he talks about the "textture" and "pores" of books. He says that books (or at least some books, like the bible he holds in) contains an "infinite profsuion" of life.

Summary: Montag needs quality of life, which is recorded in books.

7. **According to Faber, what three things are necessary to the pursuit of happiness? To what degree has Montag gained each of these three factors in his life at this point of the novel? (Page 108)**

// Life, Details and awarness.

Quality, texture of information

Leisure to digest. Page 109. The people have no time to think. The televisors tells you what to think. Need time to digest  and think on your own. Montag has achived this.

(You can play god to books but the televisors play god to you. Page 110)

The right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the first two points.

8. **Why is Faber so discouraged about changing society for the better even if a war wipes out the current culture in their country?**
Faber says that the people itself stopped reading. He thinks the culutre is ruined and that they should "restart" the culture so it can return to reading. 

9. **Why does Montag not heed Faber’s warnings and instead confronts the women in his house with a reading of “Dover Beach”?**
He doesn't like their nonsensical bladder. He wanted them to confront something "real".


10. **When Montag returns to the firehouse for work, he is divided. What are the divisions within himself that he experiences?**
page 133-135 somehere

he is himelf, but also faber??

11. **The Captain recounts his dream in which he defeats Montag’s argument for the importance of books. Choose one of the Captain’s quotes that directly argues against the power of books and explain what the quote means. page 138**

"He is no wise man that quit an certainty for an uncertainty"
In this case the certainty is staying with the firemen??

"The devil can cite scripture for his purpose"
Books are evil? But that gives power to the books, even if it's bad.

One is stupid if one eat poisoned food

These arguments mean nothing. They just say stuff. It's like playground insults, there are no arguments, just statements. 

"Books are bad"
"No books are good"

The arguemnts mean nothing. I know I'm wrong becuase of course there is a lot of worth behind the quotes. But I feel it gives no meaning to the argument. 

I can use the quotes to defeat the quotes.

"The folly of mistaking a metaphor for a proof... is born within us." 

In the argument they use argument like the dwarf one. He is saying that that metaphor, and all the other ones, are not valid arguemnts, they are not proof.

I think this whole argument is against books, because it means (barealy) nothing. I am not saying books are worthlees, but the argument displays it that way.


12. **How does Montag feel about himself as he rides the fire truck with the other men to burn more books?**
