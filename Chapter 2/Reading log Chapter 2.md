#### Guy Montag
Guy Montag works as a fireman. Firemen burn books for a living. His life is kind fo numb and quite reptetive. This changes more on that later. Montag often acts his feeling. When he wonders about the firemen origins, he ask. 

// When his wife tried to kill herself, he says it to her, voices his concerns (I think). With clarisse he.... ... I feel like Montag does not act his feelings. For example after his wife nearly took

After a while we can understand that burning books is his life, it's what he lives for. Because his wife means bearly nothing to him. Whis we learn when his wife made a suicide attempt and during their relation after that. They never act as they love eachother, or at least Mildred don't. Montag is very upset after the suicide attempt. This could be because he has some love for Mildred or that he just realiese that their relationships is empty. This because Mildred doesn't feel like their relationship is wort living for. You also get a feeling that Mildred only is with montag for his money, more on that somewhere else. 

The conversations with Clarisse is the only thing he seems to actually care about, except burning books. I get a sense that he likes to live risky. Jumps down hole and grabs pole last second. This point is strenghtened when we find out he is taking books. 

Under the  course of the first chapter Montag breaks loose from his very repetetive habits; Going to work, return from work on repeat. He starts bonding with clarisse, which also becomes a habit to him. This we know because he is very surprised when she dissapears. 
He loves habits and forms new ones easily.

Clarisse has a large impact on Montags life. Through the conversations with Clarisse he also starts thinking. He starts to doubt his marriage, why he is bruning books. As mentioned earlier, books is his life. He is questioning his life.
