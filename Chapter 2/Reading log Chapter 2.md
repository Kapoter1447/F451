Montag:
After a while we can understand that burning books is his life, it's what he lives for. Because his wife means bearly nothing to him. The conversations with Clarisse is the only thing he seems to actually care about, except burning books. I get a sense that he likes to live risky. Jumps down hole and grabs pole last second. This point is strenghtened when we find out he is taking books. 

Under the  course of the first chapter Montag breaks loose from his very repetetive habits; Going to work, return from work on repeat. He starts bonding with clarisse, which also becomes a habit to him. This we know because he is very surprised when she dissapears. 
He loves habits and forms new ones easily.

Clarisse has a large impact on Montags life. Through the conversations with Clarisse he also starts thinking. He starts to doubt his marriage, why he is bruning books. As mentioned earlier, books is his life. He is questioning his life.
