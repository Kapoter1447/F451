Now in part 2 of the book we can confirm that Montag cares for people. He spares the professor. He also wonders why things, and want to learn things. He want to keep the books. I previosly mentioned that he is brave, or at least unafraid. But now we know that he is acting by dispair

### Quotes
"Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget"

I think this qoute reminds me of why books were made to begin with, to store information, because we don't want to forget things. With books we can, as Montag said, learn from our mistakes. By burning them we forget what we once learned and what has happened. Soicety will need to "restart" because there is no ground to build on when there are no books.


"... I can't talk to my wife, she talks with walls"

While Montags wife actually talks with walls, the author could mean that walls are unsocial and not real friends. Like if you're talking to a wall.
