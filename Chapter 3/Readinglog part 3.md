montag realise why he shouldnt burn




On page 149 Beatty says "It's Perpetual motion; the thing man wanted to invent but never did. Or almost Perpetual motion. _If you let it go on, it'd burn our lifetimes out... ...it destroys responsibilities and consequences._ "
Can be connected to Montags conclusion that the sun burns life away later in the book.
