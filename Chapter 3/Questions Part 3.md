Part 3. “Burning Bright” - Discussion Questions

1. **What do you think caused Mildred to bring about the destruction of her own house by reporting that her husband had hidden books?**

I think she no longer felt important to Montag. Because Montag has prioritized the books over what she have said and wanted. For example when her friends were over, and I don't think Mildred appreciated that Montag read the book for them. She have been burning books. Maybe this is because she wanted Montag attention, which is pointed at the books.

Montag does not think this though. 


OR that she thought Montag is destroying her world and risking her life as an accompliance.

2. **Why does Beatty want Montag to wield the flame- thrower to destroy his own house and why does Montag acquiesce?**

Beatty wants Montag to burn his house because it's all his fault that they have to burn it. Montag acquiesce because the hound is close by and will kill him if he flees. 

OR because he wanted to forget his worthless relationship with Mildred, as is stated in the book. 


3. **Almost without knowing it, Montag’s hands switch off the safety on the flame- thrower aimed at Beatty. What does this show about Montag’s state of awareness or consciousness?**

I don't think he is aware or conscious of what is happening. He does what is intuition or feelings says. He do this a couple of times. For example when he reads the poem to Mildred friends or just when he screamed at the subway because he was irritated that he could not remember the verse in the bible. 

4. **Why do you think Beatty mockingly tells Montag to “pull the trigger” (p. 113) on the flame- thrower Montag has aimed at him?**

If we trust Montag's theory that Beatty wanted to die: Beatty wanted Montag to kill him and take his mocking speech with him.

5. **Is Montag justified in killing Beatty? Why or why not?**

No, just because you're angry at someone doesn't mean that you have the right to kill them. When people say "pull the trigger" in movies they often don't mean that you should actually pull the trigger.

6. **Why do the teenagers in the car try to kill Montag as he crosses the avenue? How do their actions reflect what is happening in society?**

Society is out of control. People do all sorts of stuff just because it's fun. They probably had no other reason.

7. **What is fitting about Montag’s planting books in Fireman Black’s home?**
???

8. What insight about himself does Montag gain as he reflects on his violent actions?

9. **Even though war has been declared, the news media focuses on the Mechanical Hound’s tracking of Montag. What does this say about the function of the media in society?**

Cares mostly about entertainment. Media seems to have a enormous role in society. If the police = media, and focuses on making money rather than telling important news. 

10. ** If Montag were caught and dying, what single word or phrase do you think he could say to the TV cameras that would wake the people up to the enforced triviality of their lives?**

-

11. What insight about time and the sun and his actions as a fireman does Montag get during his leisurely float on the river? What does Montag understand humans must do to counter the effects of the time-burning sun?

bla bla bla fireman burns sun burns everythhing burns

12. **How is the campfire different from the burning fire with which Montag is familiar?**

It creates community, it creates food, it creates safety. It does not destroy.

13. What is so remarkable to Montag about the voices around the campfire he hears as he hides in the trees?

14. How is Montag like the men he encounters gathered around the campfire?

15. How do the old men hope to use the books they have memorized, and what do they think will happen?

16. What makes the war and its end so unreal to Montag and his companions?

17. What do Montag’s imaginings about Mildred’s fate when the bombs fall indicate about him?

18. What, according to Granger, makes humans different from the Phoenix? How will this help humankind finally?

Humans remembers their mistakes. In the end no more mistakes will be made.

19. Why do you think that the old men fall-in behind Montag on their journey back to the city. Why has he become the leader?

20. What is the significance of the quote that Montag will save for noon when they reach the city?

  "... healing of nations"
  He saves the quote so they remember that society can be healed again.
